# klarity-mcp

> Public plugin/extension distribution for the Klarity Architect MCP server.

`klarity-mcp` packages [Klarity Architect](https://www.klarity.ai/) as an installable
plugin for AI assistant clients that speak the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).
Once installed, the plugin lets your assistant query your organization's processes,
explore the Process Index knowledge graph, and ground answers in how your business
actually runs — not generic guesses.

This repository is the canonical public surface for two install paths:

- **Claude Code / Claude** — Anthropic's plugin ecosystem.
- **ChatGPT / Codex** — OpenAI's app ecosystem.
- **Gemini CLI** — Google's CLI extension ecosystem.


## What it does

The plugin connects your AI assistant to the Klarity MCP server at
`https://architect-v2-api.klarity.ai/mcp`. Tools the assistant gets access to
include `search`, `fetch`, process-hierarchy navigation, evidence retrieval, and
Context Graph traversal. The full skill prompt lives at
[`skills/klarity-architect/SKILL.md`](./skills/klarity-architect/SKILL.md).

## Install - Claude.ai
After the plugin is approved into the official Anthropic marketplace (`claude-plugins-official`)

Customize -> Connectors -> Search -> Klarity -> Connect

> (NOTE: your organization might have to approve this connector, and you should be added as a user into Klarity for this to work)

## Install - ChatGPT
After the plugin is approved into the official OpenAI App Store

Apps -> Search -> Klarity -> Connect

> (NOTE: your organization might have to approve this app, and you should be added as a user into Klarity for this to work)

## Install — Claude Code

From a Claude Code session, install directly from this repository:

```text
/plugin install klarity-mcp@Klarity-AI/klarity-mcp
```

Or, after the plugin is approved into the official Anthropic marketplace
(`claude-plugins-official`):

```text
/plugin install klarity-mcp
```

## Install - Codex
From your terminal, run the following:

```text
codex mcp add klarity --url https://architect-v2-api.klarity.ai/mcp
```

To login:
```text
codex mcp login klarity
```

## Install — Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions install Klarity-AI/klarity-mcp
```

The Gemini CLI fetches `gemini-extension.json` from the repo root and registers
the `klarity` MCP server plus the `klarity-architect` skill as a context file.

## Authentication
You will need to be a Klarity customer to access this app.

The first time the plugin connects, your AI client will prompt you to sign in
to Klarity. the MCP will use whatever authentication is configured by your organization for Klarity.

> **Fallback:** If your client does not yet support MCP OAuth, you can issue
> a personal API key from your Klarity workspace settings and configure your
> client to send it as a `Bearer` token. Contact
> [hello@klarity.ai](mailto:hello@klarity.ai) for guidance.

## For Klarity Team - Regenerating Manifests

```bash

pytest -v
```
